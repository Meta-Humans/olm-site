          <h2>What it is</h2>
          <p>
            Open Learning Map (OLM) is a lightweight way to talk about learning as it actually happens —
            across different environments, people, and rhythms.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is being developed as an open project, with clarity and usefulness as the primary goals.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>What it isn’t</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Not a curriculum</li>
            <li>Not a school replacement</li>
            <li>Not a certification or credential</li>
            <li>Not a rigid framework for ranking learners</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Why it exists</h2>
          <p>
            People often know when learning is working, but struggle to describe it clearly enough
            to support it, repeat it, or collaborate around it.
          </p>
          <p>OLM exists to make that kind of clarity easier.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Where it is today</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A minimal public landing page</li>
            <li>Ongoing work on language and practical artifacts</li>
            <li>More public material as concepts stabilize</li>
          </ul>
